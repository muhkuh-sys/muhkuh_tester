 * Missing parameters from not selected tests prevent execution of other tests.
Example: test 1 requires a parameter "serial", which is not part of
"parameters.txt". It has to be specified on the command line. Test 2 does not
use this parameter at all. If only test 2 should be executed, the "serial"
parameter must still be present on the command line.
